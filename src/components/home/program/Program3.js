                  At Codecamp, we're committed to making education and training
                  accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial
                  situation. That's why we offer free coding courses to those in
                  need. We understand that the cost of education and training
                  programs can be a barrier for many individuals, particularly
                  those from underprivileged backgrounds or with limited
                  resources. We believe that everyone should have the
                  opportunity to learn valuable skills and pursue their career
                  aspirations, regardless of their financial circumstances.
