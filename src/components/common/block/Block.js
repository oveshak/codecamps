            At Codecamp, our mission is to make coding education accessible to
            everyone, regardless of their background or financial means. We
            believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn to code
            and pursue a career in tech, and we're committed to breaking down
            the barriers that often make this seem out of reach.
